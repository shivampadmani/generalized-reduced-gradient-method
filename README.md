# generalized-reduced-gradient-method
GRG method is most accurate method for solving non linear equations with multi variables. This method algorith is used by Excel Solver add-in. Here is the basic code representing the GRG method algorthm. I will make it more dynamic with time.
This algorithm takes gradient of a objective function in all the direction and moves on the 3D plot to reach to its minimum value. You can use this algorithm by putting your own objective function in the code.
Currently it is only developed for three variables and one Equity constraint but I welcome developers to make this code more dynamic and usable.
